# Disease Prediction Project

## Introduction:
This project focuses on predicting diseases based on various symptoms and medical attributes. The dataset used for this project contains information such as symptoms, medical history, and test results. The goal is to build machine learning models that can accurately predict diseases, which is crucial for early diagnosis and treatment planning.

## Data Exploration:
The project begins with exploring the training and testing datasets to understand the distribution of diseases and symptoms. Descriptive statistics are used to analyze the dataset's characteristics and identify any patterns or trends.

## Preprocessing:
Before building machine learning models, preprocessing steps are performed. This includes handling missing values, scaling numerical features using StandardScaler, and encoding categorical features where necessary.

## Model Building:
Four machine learning models are employed for disease prediction: Decision Tree Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest Classifier. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and the models are trained on the training set.

## Model Evaluation:
The performance of each model is evaluated using accuracy score, classification report, and confusion matrix. These metrics provide insights into the model's ability to correctly predict diseases across different classes.

## Usage:
Once the models are trained and evaluated, they can be utilized to predict diseases for new patients. Users can input their symptoms and medical information, and the models will provide predictions for their diseases.

## Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques in disease prediction, which can assist healthcare professionals in making informed decisions and improving patient outcomes through early detection and intervention.

## Technologies Used:
Python
Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
Future Improvements:
Explore additional machine learning algorithms for disease prediction.
Incorporate more extensive and diverse datasets to enhance model generalization.
Integrate real-time data sources for continuous model refinement and updates.
